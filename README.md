# Document Management Zystem

DMZ is a basic DMS with ztyle.

## Purpose

Were you ever annoyed at the papery mess of payment slips, bank mail, insurance documents both physically and digitally? \
> If not... well I am.

But...
> Fear not! DMZ is your salvation!

There is no more need for tens of half-full folders.
DMZ lets you link digital documents to the actual physical originals, whilst staying organized.

But why not just use an existing DMS?
> Didn't do the research on other DMS' and I need a project to work on.
